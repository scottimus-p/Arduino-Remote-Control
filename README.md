# Arduino-Remote-Control
A touchscreen remote control made using Arduino.

As I go through the project, I'll update this document.

This project is a remote control using a touchscreen interface made using an Arduino. A touchscreen was used to make the project more flexible so that the buttons could easily be added, removed or modified for different devices. The code uses several Adafruit libraries to handle the dirty work of controlling the touchscreen.
