# Arduino-Remote-Control #
A touchscreen remote control made using Arduino.

This project is a remote control using a touchscreen interface made using an Arduino. A touchscreen was used to make the project more flexible so that the buttons could easily be added, removed or modified for different devices. The code uses several Adafruit libraries to handle the dirty work of controlling the touchscreen.

### Components ###
Arduino Uno - https://www.adafruit.com/product/50  
Adafruit 2.8" TFT Capacitive Touch Shield - https://www.adafruit.com/product/1947  
5mm IR LED (940nm wavelength) - https://www.adafruit.com/product/387  
1 kOhm resistor

### Instructions ###
To install the code onto the Arduino, simply upload the code in the `ArduinoRemoteControl.ino` sketch to your Arduino. Assemble the components and power on the Arduino and you're set!  
  
Fortunately for me, it will work with my Toshiba TV. Unfortunately for you, it sends signals only compatible with my Toshiba TV.
